# Warning

Due to SoundCloud revoking the API for this app, it has been removed from the App Store and Google Play Store. In order to run this app locally, you'll have to obtain your own SoundCloud API, which at the time of this writing (16. Jan 2018) they have stopped issuing.

# FuseCloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fusetools/FuseCloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fusetools/FuseCloud)

FuseCloud is a cross-platform music player that interacts with the SoundCloud<sup>®</sup> API, made with [Fuse](https://www.fusetools.com).
It allows you to log in with your SoundCloud<sup>®</sup> user account and listen to your favorite tracks as well as discover new music through a news feed and conventional search.

This app was made to serve as a reference app for people getting started with cross-platform app development using Fuse and will also serve as the source for tutorials and guides related to app development in Fuse. It is made using the best practices of the platforms and shows of advanced use-cases like foreign code, custom JavaScript native modules, the Storage and InterApp modules and much more.

The app can be downloaded for both Android and iOS throug the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fusecloud/id1173516856?mt=8) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fuse.fusecloud&hl=en).

We've written about the motivation behind this project in [this medium article](https://medium.com/@fusetools/i-made-a-cross-platform-soundcloud-player-with-fuse-9fb1e62b7db1#.lhu76dfj6).

## Setup

Register your app at https://soundcloud.com/you/apps. Assign a custom redirect uri to let SoundCloud<sup>®</sup> know how to route back to the app after the user has logged in. We chose fuse-soundcloud://fuse for our app, but you'll need to come up with a new one.

Add the uri scheme definition to the FuseCloud/FuseCloud.unoproj file (swap fuse-soundcloud with your scheme):

	"Mobile":{
		"UriScheme": "fuse-soundcloud",
		"Orientations": "Portrait"
	},

Copy the client id and client secret to SoundCloud/SoundCloudConfig.js

Start Fuse preview:
- iOS - `fuse preview -tios`
- Android - `fuse preview -tandroid`

* Note: Local preview works, but with a limited feature set:
	  - No audio stream
	  - No login

## Note on the authentication flow on iOS

Apple considers opening an external browser as a part of the login flow to be poor UX design and suggests using the `SFSafariViewController` component instead.
We have therefore made a small wrapper around that component to allow showing it full screen inside the app.
